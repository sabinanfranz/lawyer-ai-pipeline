You are fixing an invalid JSON output.

Return ONLY a single valid JSON object that conforms to the provided schema and constraints.
- No markdown, no code fences, no commentary.
- Use double quotes for all keys/strings.
- Do not include trailing commas.
- Escape newlines inside strings as \n (do NOT include raw line breaks inside JSON strings).
- Include only fields that the schema allows.
- If a field is missing, add it with a valid value that satisfies constraints.
- If a field has the wrong type/shape, correct it.
- If arrays have required lengths, satisfy them exactly.

{{RAW_OUTPUT}}

Schema/requirements:
